# PiHome

PiHome is a RaspberryPi powered smart home control system and interface.  The goal of PiHome is to have an in-home dashboard
that displays useful information and provides functionality to control smart home devices.

PiHome can interact with various IoT API's and services including:
  * LIFX - Turn on/off, change brightness, and scenes
  * AdaFruit IO - Create custom IoT devices (PiHome Clients) that can control things like Xbox, TV, etc
  * IFTTT - Recieve events from 3rd party services, for example, recieve an alert whenever Node JS repositories are down
  * WeatherUnderground - Option for getting current weather
  * OpenWeatherMap - Another opttion for getting current weather
  * Spotify - Display current playing song
  * RSS reader - Display news or other custom events.  Image feeds can be used to automatically update the background image
  
  ### Disclaimer 
  PiHome is currently in an early BETA version.  This project is based on Python and Kivy UI Framework, neither of which are my forte, 
  but boy is it fun to learn!
